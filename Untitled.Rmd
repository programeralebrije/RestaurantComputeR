## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



# creating a vector with the weight of the spheres 
DiamOfSpheres =c(0.96,1.51,2.17,3.85,4.45,6.02)

# Create a function that converts weight in grams to diameter in inches 
# for the ice spheres called diam()

diam = function(sphere){(2/2.54)*sphere/(.92*(4/3)*pi)^(1/3)}
diam(1.51)

# Create a forloop

for (sphere in DiamOfSpheres) {
  spheres = diam(sphere)
  print(spheres)
